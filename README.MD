## Rules

1. We put food at random locations not on the snake.
2. Snake eats food and grows longer by 1.
3. Hitting walls or its own tail kills the snake and ends the game.
4. The speed of the snake will increase after eating 3 fruits.

### Tasks

1. Increase the length of the snake upon eating a food.
2. Place another food.
3. Make sure the game is over even if the snake hits its own tail.
